# Welcome to ottr.sh

Hey! I'm Noah, a 21 year old Software Engineer living in London.

On the internet, I pretend to be an otter :3 Outside of work I love music,
photography and video games. Sometimes I go to the Gym, and in the ski season
you'll find me on a slope somewhere in Europe.

I work for a company called Gravitational, building a piece of software called 
Teleport: the easiest, most secure way to access infrastructure. My favourite
programming language is Go!
